# CS175AndroidFinalProject
This is a final project for the CS175 Android course using Unity to make a game.

We developed using several branches based off of a main branch, but the final code to evaluate for this project is on the branch `YousefUpdates`. After cloning this repository, before evaluating the source code, please run `git checkout YousefUpdates`.

The Unity version used for this project was 2020.3.33f1, and it must be used to build the project in Unity. Of course, the Android version of the game can evaluated using the APK provided in this repository. This was generated targeting API 29. The APK is called `GuardianInTheSky.apk`.

Finally, our backlog is stored at `Group6ProjectBacklog.xlsx`, containing all information about tasks we planned and completed. Our final report is stored at `FinalReport.docx`.
