# CS175AndroidFinalProject
This is a final project for the CS175 Android course using Unity to make a game.

We developed using several branches based off of a main branch, but the final code to evaluate for this project is on the branch `YousefUpdates`. After cloning this repository, before evaluating the source code, please run `git checkout YousefUpdates`.

The Unity version used for this project was 2020.3.33f1, and it must be used to build the project in Unity. Of course, the Android version of the game can evaluated using the APK provided in this repository. This was generated targeting API 29. The APK is called `GuardianInTheSky.apk`.

Finally, our backlog and final report is accessible on Google Drive. The folder where they are stored is https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PEuS35sO-c0Kd1u0Lygl4fZ4M-vom08L?usp=sharing.
